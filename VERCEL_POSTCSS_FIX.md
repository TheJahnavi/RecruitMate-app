# Vercel PostCSS Configuration Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the PostCSS configuration issue in the Vercel deployment.

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Failed to load PostCSS config: Failed to load PostCSS config (searchPath: /vercel/path0/SmartHire/client): [Error] Loading PostCSS Plugin failed: Cannot find module 'autoprefixer'
```

This was happening because Vercel was trying to build the client application but couldn't find the required PostCSS dependencies.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json Configuration
Modified `vercel.json` to properly handle the monorepo structure:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "SmartHire/client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/SmartHire/client/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key changes:
- Explicitly pointing to `SmartHire/client/package.json` as the source
- Using `@vercel/static-build` for static site generation
- Routing all paths to the correct index.html file in the client dist directory

### 2. Verified PostCSS Configuration
Confirmed that both root and client directories have proper postcss.config.js files with the correct plugin configuration:

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 3. Dependency Management
Ensured that autoprefixer and other required dependencies are properly listed in both package.json files:
- Root package.json (c:\Users\deepa\Downloads\SmartHire\package.json)
- Client package.json (c:\Users\deepa\Downloads\SmartHire\SmartHire\client\package.json)

## How It Works
1. Vercel uses the vercel.json configuration to identify the correct build source
2. The build process navigates to the client directory where all dependencies are defined
3. PostCSS and Tailwind CSS plugins are properly loaded from the client directory
4. The build output is generated in the correct location
5. All routes are properly redirected to the SPA's index.html file

## Next Steps
1. The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
2. A new deployment should be triggered automatically
3. The PostCSS error and 404 issues should now be resolved
