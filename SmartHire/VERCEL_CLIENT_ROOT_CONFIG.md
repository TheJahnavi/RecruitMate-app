# Vercel Client Root Configuration

## Configuration Changes

1. Moved vercel.json file from project root to client directory
2. Updated vercel.json content to work with client as root directory
3. Simplified configuration to use rewrites for SPA routing

## New vercel.json Content

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Vercel Project Settings

In Vercel project settings, the Root Directory should be set to:
```
client
```

This configuration:
- Treats the client directory as the root for Vercel deployment
- Uses rewrites to redirect all routes to index.html for proper SPA routing
- Eliminates 404 errors by ensuring all paths are handled by the React application

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub
2. Update Vercel project settings to set Root Directory to "client"
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Verify that the application loads correctly without 404 errors
