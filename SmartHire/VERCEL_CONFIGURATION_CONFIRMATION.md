# Vercel Configuration Confirmation

## Verification Complete

I have confirmed that the vercel.json file meets all requirements:

### Location
✅ The vercel.json file is in the repository root directory (SmartHire/SmartHire/vercel.json)
✅ This is the top-level directory that contains the client and server folders

### Content
✅ The file contains the exact configuration you specified:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Configuration Elements
✅ `src: "client/package.json"` - Correctly points to the client folder's package.json
✅ `use: "@vercel/static-build"` - Uses static build to avoid 250MB size limit
✅ `distDir: "dist"` - Specifies the correct output directory
✅ Route destination points to `/client/dist/$1` - Correctly routes to the client build output

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push this confirmation
2. Ensure Vercel project settings have Root Directory set to "/" (repository root)
3. Monitor the deployment at https://vercel.com/thejahnavi/recruitmate-app
4. Verify that the application builds and deploys successfully without the size limit error

This configuration should resolve both the 250MB size limit issue and ensure proper routing for your deployed application.
