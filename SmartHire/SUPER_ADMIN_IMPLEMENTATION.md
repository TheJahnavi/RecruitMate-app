# SmartHire Super Admin Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the Super Admin dashboard and multi-role authentication system as requested. Here's a comprehensive overview of what has been created:

## ✅ **3-Role User Authentication System**

### **Role-Based Login Options**
The application now supports three distinct user roles with proper authentication flow:

1. **Super Admin** - Platform-level administration
2. **Company Admin** - Company-level management  
3. **HR** - Hiring and recruitment operations (existing functionality)

### **Role-Based Routing**
- **Super Admin Routes**: `/super-admin/dashboard`, `/super-admin/subscriptions`
- **Company Admin Routes**: `/company-admin/dashboard`, `/company-admin/jobs`, etc.
- **HR Routes**: `/hr/dashboard`, `/hr/jobs`, `/hr/candidates`, `/hr/upload` (existing)
