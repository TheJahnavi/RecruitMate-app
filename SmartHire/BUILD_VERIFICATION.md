# Build Verification Process

This document explains the changes made to fix the Vercel deployment issue.

## Problem Analysis

The error was:
```
npm error code ENOENT
npm error syscall open
npm error path /vercel/path0/package.json
npm error errno -2
npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/vercel/path0/package.json'
```

This happened because Vercel was looking for a `package.json` in the root directory to run the build command, but couldn't find it properly.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced root `package.json`**:
   - Added proper metadata to help Vercel recognize the project
   - Kept the build script as `cd client && npm install && npm run build`

2. **Simplified `vercel.json`**:
   - Removed explicit buildCommand and outputDirectory
   - Let Vercel use the default build process based on the package.json

3. **Ensured proper file structure**:
   - Confirmed that `client/package.json` exists with proper build script
   - Verified that the root `package.json` has a build script

## Vercel Configuration

The updated configuration should work as follows:

1. Vercel detects the root `package.json` and sees the build script
2. It runs `npm run build` which executes `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
3. This builds the client application in the `client/dist` directory
4. The routes configuration serves the static files from `client/dist`

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Update Vercel project settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Root Directory**: Leave empty
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty (will use package.json script)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty (will use default)
3. Redeploy the application

This approach should resolve the "Could not read package.json" error by ensuring Vercel can properly find and use the root package.json file.
