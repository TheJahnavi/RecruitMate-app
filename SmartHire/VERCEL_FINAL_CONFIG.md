# Vercel Final Configuration Confirmation

## Configuration Status
The vercel.json file in the client directory already contains the exact configuration specified:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
1. Uses version 2 of the Vercel configuration format
2. Uses @vercel/static-build to build a static site (not a serverless function)
3. Specifies that the build output directory is "dist"
4. Routes all requests to the files in the dist directory

## Vercel Project Settings
In Vercel project settings, ensure that:
- Root Directory is set to "client"
- Build Command is set to "npm run build"
- Output Directory is set to "dist"

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub
2. Monitor the deployment on Vercel
3. Verify that the application builds and deploys successfully without the 250MB size limit error
