# Vercel Tailwind CSS Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Vercel deployment issues related to missing Tailwind CSS dependencies.

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:
```
[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/typography'
Require stack:
- /vercel/path0/SmartHire/client/tailwind.config.ts
```

This error indicates that Vercel was not properly installing the Tailwind CSS dependencies during the build process.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Client package.json
Moved Tailwind CSS dependencies from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in the client package.json:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.15",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.3",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... other dev dependencies (Tailwind CSS dependencies removed)
  }
}
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue
1. Moving `@tailwindcss/typography`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, and `tailwindcss` to dependencies ensures they are installed during the production build process
2. Vercel's build process only installs dependencies, not devDependencies, unless specifically configured to do so
3. The tailwind.config.ts file requires these dependencies to be available during the build process
4. By moving them to dependencies, we ensure they are available when Vercel runs the build

## Next Steps
1. The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
2. A new deployment should be triggered automatically
3. The Tailwind CSS error should now be resolved
