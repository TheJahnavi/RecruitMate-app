# Vercel SPA Deployment Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the persistent 404 error in the Vercel deployment.

## Problem
The application was building successfully but showing a 404 error when accessing pages. This was due to:
1. Complex path configurations in vercel.json causing conflicts
2. SPA routing not being properly handled

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
Modified `SmartHire/client/vite.config.ts` to output build files to the root dist directory:
```ts
build: {
  outDir: '../../dist',  // Changed from './dist'
  // ... other config
}
```

### 2. Added SPA Routing Support
Created `SmartHire/client/public/_redirects` file with:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

This tells Vercel to serve index.html for all routes, allowing the client-side router to handle navigation.

### 3. Verified Build Script
Confirmed that the root package.json has the correct build script:
```json
"build": "cd SmartHire/client && npm install && npm run build"
```

## How It Works
1. Vercel uses the root package.json build script
2. The script navigates to the client directory and builds the app
3. Vite outputs the build to the root dist directory (../../dist)
4. The _redirects file ensures all routes serve index.html for SPA routing
5. Vercel's zero-config deployment handles the rest

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Trigger a new deployment on Vercel
3. Verify that the 404 error is resolved
