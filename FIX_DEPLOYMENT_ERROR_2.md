# Fix for Vercel Deployment Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'

## Problem

The Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:
```
[vite:css] Failed to load PostCSS config (searchPath: /vercel/path0/SmartHire/client): [Error] Loading PostCSS Plugin failed: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by incorrect path configurations in several files:

1. **Missing PostCSS configuration**: The client directory was missing its own `postcss.config.js` file
2. **Incorrect vercel.json paths**: The paths were pointing to `client/package.json` instead of `SmartHire/client/package.json`
3. **Incorrect package.json build scripts**: The build scripts were navigating to `client` instead of `SmartHire/client`
4. **Incorrect configuration file paths**: Various configuration files (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, drizzle.config.ts) had incorrect paths

## Solution

### 1. Added Missing PostCSS Configuration

Created a `postcss.config.js` file in the `SmartHire/client` directory:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Updated vercel.json

Changed the paths to correctly point to the nested client directory:
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "SmartHire/client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/SmartHire/client/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Updated Root package.json Build Scripts

Changed the build scripts to navigate to the correct directory:
```json
"build": "cd SmartHire/client && npm install && npm run build",
"vercel-build": "cd SmartHire/client && npm install && npm run build"
```

### 4. Updated Configuration Files

Updated paths in multiple configuration files:

**vite.config.ts**:
- Updated alias paths to include `SmartHire` directory
- Updated root path to `SmartHire/client`
- Updated build output directory to `SmartHire/dist/public`

**tailwind.config.ts**:
- Updated content paths to include `SmartHire` directory

**drizzle.config.ts**:
- Updated schema path to `SmartHire/shared/schema.ts`

## Verification

After making these changes, the application should deploy correctly to Vercel with:
1. Proper installation of dependencies in the client directory
2. Correct PostCSS configuration with Tailwind CSS
3. Proper path resolution for all configuration files
4. Correct build output routing

## Deployment Instructions

1. Commit all changes to GitHub
2. Vercel should automatically deploy the application
3. The build process will now:
   - Navigate to `SmartHire/client`
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the React application
   - Output to `SmartHire/client/dist`
   - Serve all routes from `SmartHire/client/dist/index.html`

This fix ensures that all paths are correctly configured for the nested directory structure and that Tailwind CSS dependencies are properly resolved during the build process.
