# Deployment Verification Guide

## Monitoring Deployment

Your application is now deploying to Vercel. You can monitor the deployment progress at:
https://vercel.com/thejahnavi/recruitmate-app

## Expected Outcome

After the deployment completes successfully, your application should be accessible at:
https://chandanasgit-recruit-mate-app.vercel.app/

## Verification Steps

Once the deployment is complete, verify that:

1. **No Build Errors**: The Vercel build log should show successful completion without errors
2. **Application Loads**: The main page should load without a blank screen
3. **Routing Works**: Navigation between pages should function correctly
4. **Assets Load**: CSS and JavaScript assets should load properly (no 404 errors)

## Common Post-Deployment Checks

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open Developer Tools and check for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Network Requests**: Ensure all assets are loading with 200 status codes
3. **Test All Pages**: Navigate to all major pages (Landing, Login, Dashboards)
4. **Test Authentication Flow**: Try logging in with test credentials

## Test Credentials

Use the following credentials to test the application:

- **Super Admin**: 
  - Email: superadmin@smarthire.com
  - Password: password123

- **Company Admin**: 
  - Email: admin@techcorp.com
  - Password: password123

- **HR User**: 
  - Email: hr1@techcorp.com
  - Password: password123

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check Vercel Logs**: Review deployment logs for any errors
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, reach out for further assistance

## Success Indicators

A successful deployment will show:
- Green "Ready" status in Vercel dashboard
- Application loading without errors
- All pages accessible
- Proper styling and functionality

The fixes implemented should resolve the previous "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" error by ensuring proper path configurations and dependency resolution.
