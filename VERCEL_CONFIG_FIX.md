# Vercel Configuration Fix

This document outlines the additional changes made to fix the persistent 404 error in the Vercel deployment.

## Problem
Even after updating the vite.config.ts and adding the _redirects file, the application was still showing a 404 error. This was due to Vercel not properly understanding the build structure.

## Additional Solution Implemented

### Added vercel.json Configuration
Created a `vercel.json` file in the repository root with explicit configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
1. Explicitly tells Vercel to use the root package.json for building
2. Uses @vercel/static-build to avoid serverless function size limits
3. Specifies the dist directory for output
4. Routes all paths to index.html for proper SPA handling

## How It Works
1. Vercel uses the vercel.json configuration instead of trying to auto-detect
2. The build process follows the root package.json build script
3. The client application builds to the dist directory
4. All routes are redirected to index.html for client-side routing

## Next Steps
1. The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
2. A new deployment should be triggered automatically
3. The 404 error should now be resolved
